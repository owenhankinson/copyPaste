# copyPaste Application

This app in short answers a much needed problem that many developers have when they code, the issue of copying and pasting. This app was created in order to answer this problem by providing a more accessible way to work with your clipboard. 

The app offers a few features right now including a copying history and a way to go back and select previous copy-events. Another feature the app includes is a copy-all button, (designed with .csv files in mind) which lets you copy every selection with one click. 

More features are to be added soon...
